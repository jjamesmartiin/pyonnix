# Introduction
This repository is a way for me to easily template and create new python projects in nixos. 

There might be a better way to make the environment (maybe by adding it to the nix store?) but I haven't personally felt like it was neccessary yet.

This seems to work for making python terminal apps and basic charting. Feel free to fork or copy and use for your own needs.
